# `splits.txt`

This file contains file splits for a module.

Example:

```yaml
path/to/file.cpp:
	.text       start:0x80047E5C end:0x8004875C
	.ctors      start:0x803A54C4 end:0x803A54C8
	.data       start:0x803B1B40 end:0x803B1B60
	.bss        start:0x803DF828 end:0x803DFA8C
	.bss        start:0x8040D4AC end:0x8040D4D8 common
```

## Format

```yaml
path/to/file.cpp: [file attributes]
    section     [section attributes]
    ...
```

- `path/to/file.cpp` The name of the source file, usually relative to `src`. The file does **not** need to exist to start.  
  This corresponds to an entry in `configure.py` for specifying compiler flags and other options.

### File attributes

- `comment:` Overrides the `mw_comment_version` setting in [`config.yml`](/config/GAMEID/config.example.yml) for this file. See [Comment section](comment_section.md).  

`comment:0` is used to disable `.comment` section generation for a file that wasn't compiled with `mwcc`.  
Example: `TRK_MINNOW_DOLPHIN/ppc/Export/targsupp.s: comment:0`  
This file was assembled and only contains label symbols. Generating a `.comment` section for it will crash `mwld`.

### Section attributes

- `start:` The start address of the section within the file. For DOLs, this is the absolute address (e.g. `0x80001234`). For RELs, this is the section-relative address (e.g. `0x1234`).
- `end:` The end address of the section within the file.
- `align:` Specifies the alignment of the section. If not specified, the default alignment for the section is used.
- `rename:` Writes this section under a different name when generating the split object. Used for `.ctors$10`, etc.
- `common` Only valid for `.bss`. See [Common BSS](common_bss.md).
- `skip` Skips this data when writing the object file. Used for ignoring data that's linker-generated.

## Game REL: pairing header-only units with un-split `.text` gaps

In the game REL (and likely the other RELs), every original translation unit
that includes `header_rep_data.h` begins its `.rodata` with the same 80-byte
(0x50) `repHeaderData` block. That block turns the `.rodata` layout into a map
of TU boundaries, and two consequences follow:

1. **A `data_only/rep_*` unit that owns exactly 0x50 bytes of `.rodata` and no
   `.text` is a TU whose code has not been split yet.** Because units appear
   in the same order in every section, its code is the un-split `.text` gap
   (`auto_00_*_text`) between the text of its rodata-order neighbours. If that
   gap references no `lbl_3_rodata_*` at all, the pairing is consistent: a
   header-only TU has no float constants of its own. Give the unit that
   `.text` range (and rename it once its functions say what it is).
2. **A `.text` gap that references no `.rodata` of its own is not a TU by
   itself.** It belongs to an adjacent unit, or to a header-only unit as
   above. A gap that does reference `.rodata` ties itself to whichever unit
   owns those constants: MWCC pools float constants per TU, so shared
   constants mean the same TU.

Done so far with this method:

| header-only unit | `.text` gap | became |
|---|---|---|
| `rep_3BD8` | `0x15C5F4-0x15F574` | `match_setup/stat_book.c` |
| `rep_1720` | `0x97144-0x993A8` | `match_setup/match_scene.c` |
| `rep_1668` | `0x9143C-0x91520` | `hud/toyfield_score_update.c` |
| `rep_1A80` | `0xAC9F8-0xAFDC0` | `match_setup/pause_menu.c` |
| `rep_1AD0` | `0xAFDC0-0xB1CB0` | `practice/practice_modes.c` |
| `rep_1B20` | `0xB1CB0-0xB3A4C` | `practice/guided_practice.c` |
| `rep_31A0` | `0x106DFC-0x110634` | `minigame/minigame_framework.c` |
| `rep_1C68` | `0xB707C-0xB79AC` | `practice/baserunning_practice.c` (grouping supported by names/call graph and section order; original TU boundary inferred) |

By rule 2, gap `0x20A60-0x20CEC` was folded into `batting/batter_ai.c`,
since it shares batter_ai's pooled constants at `.rodata` 0x930-0x93C.

Still open, as of 2026-10-08:

| header-only unit(s) | `.text` window | contents |
|---|---|---|
| `rep_9B0` | `0x219CC-0x21C90` | 4 fns, runner drawing items |
| `rep_A78` | `0x249E8-0x251E4` | 7 fns incl. `initializeAnimations` |
| `rep_1BC8`, `rep_1C18` | `0xB3B70-0xB707C` | 35 fns: practice menus and pitching practice; 2 TUs |
| `rep_3A48`, `rep_3A98` | `0x157E28-0x15B79C` | 28 fns currently assigned to `practice/practice_scene.c` via `rep_3A48`; likely 20 HUD/menu functions followed by 8 free-fielding functions belonging to `rep_3A98`. The latter reference all three jump tables at `.data 0x26F00-0x26F78`. Exact TU boundary still needs verification. |
| `rep_CC8`, `rep_D18`, `rep_D68`, `rep_DB8` | `0x5985C` gap (2 fns) plus, by position, part of `fielding/fielder.c` | 4 TUs sit between fielder.c's rodata and match_loading's, so `fielder.c`'s 214 KB `.text` range probably spans several original TUs |

Where several header-only units share one window, split the window at
function boundaries so that each TU's functions stay contiguous; the call
graph and function names usually show where the themes change.
